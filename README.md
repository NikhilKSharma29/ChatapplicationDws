   docker-compose up
   ```
   This will start:
   - Next.js app on http://localhost:3000
   - Mock JSON server on http://localhost:3001

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build
   ```

### Development without Docker

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that runs on every push to `main` or `develop` branches and on pull requests. The pipeline includes:

- Linting checks
- Tests (if configured)
- Build verification
- Docker image build and push (on main/develop branches)

### Required Secrets for CI/CD

For the Docker image push to work, you need to set these secrets in your GitHub repository:
- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`: Your Docker Hub access token

## üê≥ Production Deployment

### Using Docker

   docker run -p 3000:3000 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key your-username/chat-app
   ```

### Using Docker Compose (Production)
